# HBase Kubernetes Operator

HBase Kubernetes Operator automates the deployment, provisioning, and orchestration of HBase running on Kubernetes based on [Operator Framework](https://operatorframework.io/) pattern.

Current features:

- Provisions a service, a config, masters, and regionservers
- Graceful rolling upgrade when any of the config or pod specs change

Current limitations:
- Operates only on healthy clusters, manual intervention is required in case of issues (it's the job of HBase to recover from failures)
- Graceful scaling down of regionservers isn't supported

Installation instructions:
1. run `make install` to tell k8s how to understand the Custom HBase Resource (CRD)
2. run `make deploy IMG=timoha/hbase-k8s-controller:latest` to deploy the operator
3. modify [sample HBase CRD](https://github.com/timoha/hbase-k8s-operator/config/samples/hbase_v1_hbase.yaml) to have the desired config
4. run `kubectl apply -f config/samples/hbase_v1_hbase.yaml` to tell the operator what to deploy.
5. now you can go and focus on actual features of your product

It's expected that operator and HBase will be deployed in `hbase` namespace.
